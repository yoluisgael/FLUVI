FLUVI is a virtual-time vehicular traffic simulator built on **Cellular Automata** (CA) theory. Developed as a Bachelor's thesis at the **Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN) — ESCOM**, it models complex urban traffic behavior using a modified implementation of **Rule 184**, extended to support multi-lane roads, dynamic intersections, configurable probabilistic connections, and live Shannon entropy metrics.

The system was designed to analyze and optimize traffic flow near academic zones, enabling researchers and urban planners to simulate scenarios before implementing real infrastructure changes.

- `25-45%` — Moderate
- `45-60%` — Good occupancy
- `60-75%` — High
- `75-85%` — Very high
- `≥85%` — Critical

### Speed (%)
- `<15%` — Stopped
- `15-30%` — Slow
- `30-50%` — Moderate
- `50-70%` — Flowing
- `70-80%` — Very fluid
- `≥80%` — Excellent

### Vehicular Flow (veh/s)
- `<0.8` — Very low
- `0.8-2.0` — Low
- `2.0-3.0` — Moderate
- `3.0-4.0` — Good
- `4.0-4.5` — High
- `≥4.5` — Excellent

### Rate of Change (veh/s)
- `<-3` — Fast decrease
- `-3 to -1` — Slow decrease
- `-1 to 1` — Stable
- `1 to 3` — Slow growth
- `3 to 6` — Moderate growth
- `≥6` — Fast growth

### Shannon Entropy (bits)

Metric that measures the **diversity of the 8 transitions** of the cellular automaton based on the 3-cell neighborhood (left-center-right).

#### Formula
```
H = -Σ(p_i × log₂(p_i))
```

Where `p_i` is the empirical probability (relative frequency) of each transition:

```
p_i = (number of times transition i occurred) / (total cells)
```

#### 8 Measured Transitions (L-C-R Neighborhood)

The calculation is based on the **binary** state of the 3-cell neighborhood in the previous step:
- **0** = empty cell
- **1** = cell with a vehicle (any type 1-6)

| Index | Configuration (L-C-R) | Binary Value | Neighborhood Description |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 0 | `000` | 0 | Empty — Empty — Empty |
| 1 | `001` | 1 | Empty — Empty — Vehicle |
| 2 | `010` | 2 | Empty — Vehicle — Empty |
| 3 | `011` | 3 | Empty — Vehicle — Vehicle |
| 4 | `100` | 4 | Vehicle — Empty — Empty |
| 5 | `101` | 5 | Vehicle — Empty — Vehicle |
| 6 | `110` | 6 | Vehicle — Vehicle — Empty |
| 7 | `111` | 7 | Vehicle — Vehicle — Vehicle |

**Note**: The configuration is evaluated in the previous state of the automaton (step t-1) for each cell.

#### Value Interpretation

- **0 bits**: Static system (single neighborhood configuration)
  - Example: All cells empty (000 in all positions)
- **~1 bit**: Low diversity (1-2 configurations dominate)
  - Example: Very repetitive pattern with little variation
- **1.5-2.5 bits**: Moderate diversity (mix of several configurations)
  - Example: System with varied traffic patterns
- **3.000 bits**: Theoretical maximum (uniform distribution of all 8 configurations)
  - Example: All configurations occur with equal frequency (log₂(8) = 3)

#### Classification Ranges

- `<0.5` — Homogeneous (very simple system)
- `0.5-1.0` — Low diversity
- `1.0-1.8` — Low-moderate diversity
- `1.8-2.5` — Moderate-high diversity
- `≥2.5` — High diversity (very dynamic system)

### System States

#### 🔴 COLLAPSE
- **Condition**: `density >80% && speed <15%`
- **Description**: Streets are severely congested and nearly paralyzed
- **Typical throughput**: 0-1 veh/s
- **Required action**: Reduce generation or improve exits

#### 🟢 OPTIMAL
- **Condition**: `density 25-60% && speed ≥50%`
- **Description**: Maximum system efficiency: good balance between density and speed
- **Typical throughput**: 2.5-5 veh/s
- **Feature**: System operating at maximum performance

#### 🟠 CONGESTED
- **Condition**: `density >60% && speed <35%`
- **Description**: High vehicle density with slow movement
- **Typical throughput**: 1-2 veh/s
- **Warning**: Risk of collapse if density increases

#### 🔵 UNDERUSED
- **Condition**: `density <25%`
- **Description**: Low street occupancy, available capacity
- **Typical throughput**: 0-1.5 veh/s
- **Recommendation**: Consider increasing generation to use available capacity

#### 🟡 MODERATE
- **Condition**: Other combinations
- **Description**: Acceptable traffic conditions with room for improvement
- **Typical throughput**: Variable
- **Feature**: Default state, functional but improvable

## Smart Parking

The system allows converting buildings into functional parking lots that interact with vehicular flow.

### Parking Configuration

**Basic parameters:**
- **Capacity**: Maximum number of vehicles the parking lot can store
- **Entry Connections**: Specific cells on streets where vehicles can enter
- **Exit Connections**: Cells where vehicles leaving the parking lot are generated

**Hourly Probabilities:**
- **Entry Probability** (0-100%): Percentage of vehicles that decide to enter when passing an entry cell
- **Exit Probability** (0-100%): Probability percentage that a vehicle exits the parking lot each frame
- Configurable for each of the 24 hours of the day
- Predefined profiles: Normal, Office, Shopping Center

### System Behavior

**Vehicle Entry:**
- Vehicles arriving at an entry cell are evaluated according to the probability configured for that hour
- If they accept entry, they disappear from traffic and the parking counter increases
- If they reject, they continue their route normally
- Anticipatory absorption system: detects vehicles before they reach the entry

**Vehicle Exit:**
- Vehicles are generated at exit cells according to the hourly probability
- A vehicle is only generated if the exit cell and the previous cell are empty (prevents collisions)
- The type of generated vehicle is random (1-6)
- The parking counter decreases when each vehicle is generated

**Validations:**
- Entries and exits cannot be created in the same cell
- Cells are validated to be within street limits (valid lanes and positions)
- The parking lot does not allow entries if it is full
- Does not generate exits if it is empty

### Scenario Management

The system allows saving and loading complete simulation configurations that include:

**Saved Information:**
- All streets with their positions, angles, lanes, and vertices (curves)
- All buildings with their visual properties
- Complete parking configuration (capacity, connections, probabilities)
- Street connections
- Simulation parameters (generation probabilities, lane changes)

**Features:**
- **Save Scenario**: Exports the current configuration as a JSON file
- **Load Scenario**: Imports a previously saved configuration
- Parking lots maintain their hourly probabilities when saving/loading
- Allows creating libraries of test scenarios

**Features**:
- **Per-day configuration**: Independent multipliers for each day of the week (Sunday to Saturday)
- **Per-hour configuration**: 24 sliders (one per hour of the day: 00:00 to 23:00)
- **Value range**: 0.0 (no traffic) to 3.0 (very intense traffic)
- **Range independence**: Each slider controls exclusively its time range (e.g. 08:00 controls from 08:00 to 08:59)
- **Quick presets**:
  - 🏢 **Workday**: Peaks at entry/exit hours (7-9 AM, 6-8 PM)
  - 🎉 **Weekend**: Relaxed pattern with afternoon peak
  - 📊 **Constant**: Uniform traffic (1.0) all day
  - 🌙 **Night**: Inverted pattern (high at night, low during day)
- **Additional functions**:

**Benefits of Modular Architecture**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific and well-defined function
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one module do not affect others
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new functionality without modifying existing code
- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in other projects
- **Testing**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Debugging**: Easier to locate and fix errors
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work in parallel

### Initialization Flow

1. **PixiJS Loading**: PixiJS library is loaded from CDN
2. **PixiApp Initialization**: Singleton that creates the PixiJS application
   - Attempts to use WebGL with GPU acceleration
   - Falls back to Canvas 2D if it fails
   - Replaces the traditional HTML5 canvas
3. **Asset Loading**: `AssetLoader` loads all textures asynchronously
4. **Scene Graph Creation**: `SceneManager` creates the rendering layers
5. **Renderer Initialization**: All specialized renderers are created
6. **Camera Setup**: `CameraController` configures zoom and pan
7. **Loop Start**: PixiJS starts the automatic rendering loop

### Layer System (Z-Index)

```
Debug Layer   (z: 40)  → Vertices, debug elements
UI Layer      (z: 30)  → Labels, edit handles
Buildings     (z: 25)  → Buildings
Vehicles      (z: 20)  → Vehicles (animated)
Connections   (z: 15)  → Connection lines between streets
Streets       (z: 10)  → Streets with textures
Background    (z: 0)   → Background (solid color)
```

### Rendering Cycle

```javascript
// Every frame (typical 60 FPS):
PixiApp.ticker → SceneManager.update(delta) → {
  1. Update background color (DayNightCycle)
  2. Update vehicles (CarroRenderer)
  3. Update labels if state changes
  4. Update connections if state changes
  5. Update vertices if state changes
  6. PixiJS automatically renders the scene graph
}
```

### Implemented Optimizations

- **Selective Rendering**: Only sprites are updated when their data changes
- **Sprite Pooling**: Object reuse to avoid garbage collection
- **State-Based Updates**: Labels, connections, and vertices are only rendered when they change
- **Dirty Flags**: Flag system to detect changes
- **Batch Rendering**: PixiJS groups similar sprites in a single draw call (WebGL)
- **Texture Atlas**: Combined textures to reduce GPU state changes

### Interactivity

The system uses native PixiJS events:
- **pointerdown/pointerup**: Clicks on objects
- **pointermove**: Mouse movement over objects
- **pointerover/pointerout**: Hover for tooltips
- **Capture Phase**: CameraController intercepts events before PixiJS for pan/zoom

### Compatibility

- **WebGL**: Full GPU acceleration (preferred)
- **Canvas 2D**: Automatic fallback if WebGL is not available
- **Cross-platform**: Works in all modern browsers
- **Responsive**: Adapts to window size

### Benefits of Using PixiJS

- **Integrated debugging** with browser DevTools

**Maintainability:**
- **Separation of concerns** with specialized renderers
- **Modular code** easy to extend and maintain
- **Layer system** clarifies rendering order
- **Complete PixiJS documentation** available

## Requirements

### Required Software
- **Python 3.x**: To run the local HTTP server
- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **WebGL**: For GPU acceleration (optional, Canvas 2D fallback available)
- **Internet Connection**: To load PixiJS from CDN
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Required for the application to work

### Why is a local server needed?

WebGL and resource loading (textures, images) require the application to run from an HTTP server due to browser CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security policies. **It is not possible to open `index.html` directly** from the file system (`file://`) for WebGL to work correctly.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Start the Local Server

**Option A - Windows (Recommended):**
```bash
# Navigate to the main/ folder
cd main

# Run the .bat file
START_SERVER.bat
```

**Option B - Any Operating System:**
```bash
# Navigate to the main/ folder
cd main

# Run the Python server directly
python server.py
```

The server will start on port **8000** and you will see:
```
============================================================
WEB SERVER FOR FLUVI - TRAFFIC SIMULATOR
============================================================

Server started successfully!

Open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:8000
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Step 2: Open in the Browser

1. With the server running, open your browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:8000**
3. The simulation will load automatically:
   - PixiJS initialization with **WebGL enabled**
   - Loading textures and assets from `assets/images/`
   - Rendering the initial scene with GPU acceleration
   - Layer system activated

### Step 3: Use the Application

Use the side panel to:
- Configure simulation parameters
- Enable/disable edit mode
- View real-time metrics
- Export/import configurations

**Camera Controls:**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Mouse scroll | Zoom in/out |
| Click + drag | Pan (move camera) |
| Ctrl+B | Hide/show sidebar |

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 8000 is already in use"
**Solution:** Another process is using port 8000
- Close other server instances
- Or modify `server.py` to use a different port (e.g. 8080, 3000)

### "WebGL is not available"
**Solution:** Your browser/GPU does not support WebGL
- The system will automatically use Canvas 2D as fallback
- You will see the message: "WebGL not available, using Canvas 2D renderer..."
- The application will work, but with lower performance

### "Textures won't load"
**Solution:** You are opening `index.html` directly with `file://`
- **You must use the local server** so that CORS allows loading images
- Run `START_SERVER.bat` and open `http://localhost:8000`

### "Python is not recognized as a command"
**Solution:** Python is not installed or is not in PATH
- Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
- Restart the terminal after installing

### Verify that WebGL is working
Open the browser console (F12) and look for:
```
WebGL available, using GPU acceleration
PixiApp initialized successfully
```

If you see these messages, **PixiJS is using WebGL correctly**.

## Python Metrics Analyzer

FLUVI includes an **Advanced Metrics Analyzer** that allows analyzing exported CSV files using Python directly in the browser via **Pyodide** (Python compiled to WebAssembly).

### Generated Visualizations

**1. Temporal Analysis (4 charts)**
- Density vs Time
- Flow vs Time
- Speed vs Time
- Traffic states classified by color

**2. Fundamental Diagram (2 charts)**
- Entropy vs Density (colored by Flow)
- **Heatmap by Day and Hour**

**3. Statistical Distributions**
- Density and Flow Histograms
- Comparative Boxplots

### Heatmap

Visualizes traffic patterns organized by:
- **Y Axis**: Days of the week (Monday - Sunday)
- **X Axis**: Hours of the day (0 - 23)
- **Color**: 🟡 yellow (low density) → 🔴 red (high density)

### How to Use

1. Run a simulation in FLUVI
2. Export metrics using "Download CSV"
3. Click "Analyze Metrics" (blue button)
4. Load the CSV file
5. Wait for processing (~60 sec first time, ~5 sec after)
6. Navigate between the 3 tabs
7. Download images (individual or ZIP)

### Features

- **100% in the browser**: No Python installation required
- **Full privacy**: Local data, not sent to servers
- **Professional visualizations**: matplotlib, pandas, scipy
- **Advanced metrics**: State classification, critical capacity, correlations, anomaly detection
